# Tailwind CSS Guide

## üìñ Introduction

**Tailwind CSS** is a utility-first CSS framework that enables developers to rapidly build modern and responsive user interfaces. Instead of writing custom CSS, you apply predefined classes directly to your HTML elements.

### ‚ú® Key Features:
- **Utility-first Design**: Use small, composable utility classes to style your components.
- **Responsive Design**: Built-in support for responsive breakpoints.
- **Customizable**: Extend and customize Tailwind using the `tailwind.config.js` file.
- **Purges Unused CSS**: Keeps your production CSS file small by including only the styles you use.
- **Integrated Workflow**: Works seamlessly with modern build tools like Vite, Webpack, etc.

## üöÄ Installation

Follow these steps to set up Tailwind CSS in a **React + Vite** project:

### 1. Initialize a React + Vite Project
First, create a new Vite project with React:
```bash
npm create vite@latest my-tailwind-project --template react
cd my-tailwind-project
```
### 2. Install Tailwind CSS and Dependencies
Run the following commands to install Tailwind CSS along with ```postcss``` and ```autoprefixer```:
```bash
npm install -D tailwindcss postcss autoprefixer
npx tailwindcss init
```
### 3. Config ```tailwind.config.js```
Edit the ```tailwind.config.js``` file to specify where Tailwind should scan for utility classes:
```bash
module.exports = {
  content: [
    "./index.html",
    "./src/**/*.{js,jsx,ts,tsx}", // Scan all files in the src directory
  ],
  theme: {
    extend: {}, // Extend default themes here if needed
  },
  plugins: [],
};
```
### 4. Add Tailwind directives to CSS
Create a new css file in your src directory (e.g., ```src/index.css```) and add the following Tailwind directives:
```bash
@tailwind base;
@tailwind components;
@tailwind utilities;
```

### 5. Import CSS into Your Project
In you ```src/main.jsx``` file, import the Tailwind CSS file:
```bash
import './index.css';
```

### 6. Start the Development Server
```bash
npm run dev
```

### üßê Troubleshooting
1. **Styles Not Applying?**
